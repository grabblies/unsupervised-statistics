title: Where to buy a reasonably priced house in Asheville
---

Asheville is a wonderful city. However, like many other wonderful cities, it is a city that other people have discovered is wonderful. As such, it has become a lot more expensive than it used to be. In the golden 1990s, West Asheville was the boonies, and I remember being sensitive to the (middle school) social implications of living on "that" side of town.

Little did I know that it would become the center of Asheville's reemergence.
